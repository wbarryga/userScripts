### Bookmarklet, Beta
1. This greatly simplifies installation by allowing users to drag and drop a bookmarklet. Simple!

## Functionalities
### Avature Search
  1. Want to avoid adding duplicates to Avature? Click the "Avature" button that opens a new tab with the lead's name pre-populated. This helps save time by avoiding copying-pasting

## Installation
### Supported Browsers
1. Google Chrome

### Installing the Bookmarklet

  
### Known Issues
  1. The program will only work if it "fires" after the profile page has loaded completely. I've tried numerous strategies to time this correctly but none that works 100%. Currently, the program is set to wait 2.5 seconds before firing.
  2. If you notice the buttons are "common" looking (i.e. gray) their functionalities won't work. Refresh the page.
  3. Right-clicking a profile and opening in a new window will cause the above issue. Try loading the page by left-clicking.
